 * Exercise 4.2 - ASSIGNMENT 1
 * 
 * You now have enough knowledge to complete Assignment 1. You will need to import the Scanner class, declare an object in the Scanner class,
 * use appropriate variables, manipulate them, and output them. Please review the other lessons as needed. The instructions are included here
 * as well as on Google Classroom for your convenience.
 * 
 * It _may_ be helpful to complete up to lesson 5.4 prior to completing this, but is not necessary (you can always come back and improve this!)
 * 
 * ==========ASSIGNMENT 1==========
 * 
 * In groups of 1-3 people, write a program to do the following:
 * •	Declare and initialize 3 variables: a string called myName, a decimal value called quotient, and an integer value called myNumber
 * •	Prompt the user to enter their name (save as myName)
 * •	Referring to the user by name, ask them for their number (get this value into the myNumber variable)
 * •	Using appropriate formatting, tabs, spacing, etc. find the quotient of their number when divided by each number from 1 to 10. 
 * •	Output this to the console (sample output on the Assignment Sheet on Google Classroom)
 * •	Comment appropriately (communication marks!)
 * •	Swap programs with another group or student to compare, see if you can make or suggest any improvements
 *	
 * EXTENSIONS:
 * 1)	Was your program written efficiently? Why or why not? If it wasn’t efficient, can you modify it to use fewer lines of code for the 
 * 		calculations? (hint: tomorrow’s review program is on loops – get a head start!)
 * 2)	Why are the outputs in my sample all rounded off? How do the different data types affect the accuracy of the answers? Research or 
 *		test out changes that would get more accurate quotients. Can you round your answers to two decimal places?
 *
